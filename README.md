## Introduction
The use of LLMs (Large Language Models) in generative symbolic music, including MIDI, has become a widely explored topic in the academic world, with good potential for commercial application use. 
One such example is **AutoBeat**. 

AutoBeat is a MIDI beat generator plugin, made with JUCE, which uses a fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate MIDI beats in various electronic music genres and with parameters given by the user. 

All processing is done in the plugin and on the user's device, without the requirement for an Internet connection.
