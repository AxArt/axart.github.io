## Introduction
The use of LLMs in the field of generative symbolic music, including MIDI, has become a widely explored topic in the academic world, with good potential for commercial application use. This presentation will focus on one such example, named AutoBeat. AutoBeat is a MIDI beat generator plugin, made with JUCE, which uses a fine-tuned, embedded GPT-2 model to generate MIDI beats in various electronic music genres and with parameters given by the user. We will present an overview of AutoBeatâ€™s architecture and technical design, including the various challenges that arose during its development and how we managed to overcome them. We will also demonstrate some of the techniques that an AI model can be embedded into or used with a JUCE plugin.
